This was my 2nd Year project for the data structures and algorithms module.
I achieved 96% for this individual project.

The project consisted of importing images and the manipulating them accordingly;
- Greyscaling
- Noise Reduction
- Edge Detection
And finally, we were given an image of a cheetah, and we had to count it's spots, 
using a shape mask of different relative circle sizes.
- Spot Detection

Outputting the results, which were then compared using test scripts, which had
to be above 98% accurate.
